# Welcome 

Welcome to the UKAN Computational Acoustics Knowledgebase: a home for the computational acoustics research, development and user community in the UK and beyond.

How to use this site:

- Use the **core concepts** sections to learn about the underlying concepts that make computational acoustics possible.
- Use the **tutorials** to explore real computational acoustics code with detailed explanations. 
- Use the **software guides** for help with common computational acoustics software packages, both commercial and open source.
- Browse the **user-submitted code** section to explore computational acoustics code submitted by our users.
- Wherever you see this logo <i class="fas fa-rocket"></i> at the top of the page, you can run that code directly in your browser by launching a Binder environment.
- Want to suggest changes or contribute to the knowledgebase? Read our [guide for contributors](about/contribution-guide).

```{admonition} More content to follow!
:class: tip
This is a pre-alpha version of the knowledgebase. Once up and running, it will also include:

* Guides to using common commercial and open-source CA software
* Example data for testing algorithms
* Community features

```
