## Who is the knowledgebase for?

The knowledgebase is for anyone using computational acoustics methods, from beginner to expert.

## What does the knowledgebase contain?

There are **four** main types of content on the knowledgebase:

- **Core concepts:** these pages cover the basic concepts required to understand and develop computational acoustics code, with interactive examples.

- **Tutorials:** these are examples of computational acoustics methods in use, with detailed explanations.

- **Software guides:** these are guides for using common computational acoustics software packages, whether commercial or open source.

- **User-submitted code:** these are existing computational acoustics projects developed by our users. We have some documentation requirements, but these are generally much lower than for our tutorial material. Please note that unlike the rest of the knowledgebase, user-submitted code is *not necessarily open-source*, so please check the individual licenses. User-submitted code is hosted on GitHub, so feedback and improvements can be suggested to the auythors directly using normal GitHub interactions. Please note that user-submitted code will vary considerably in up-to-dateness, size, functionality, and quality of documentation.

As the knowledgebase grows, we plan to include example data which you can download and use for simulations and benchmarking, as well as a host of community features.

## Where should I start?

If you're new to computational acoustics, we recommend you make use of the [method choice flowchart](../choose/flowchart) to help you decide which method is suitable for your application, and then explore the tutorials for that method to get to grips with how it works. Once you're happy with the basics, you might like to read up on the theory of the method. You can use the [community features](../community/community) to ask for help in applying the method to your particular use case, or look for similar application areas in the [user-submitted code directory](../user/user).

If you're looking for something and can't find it, consider [making a suggestion](../about/contribute-suggest) for us to include it in the future, or [contribute the change yourself](../about/contribute-contribute).
