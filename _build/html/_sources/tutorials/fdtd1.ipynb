    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use a simple [explicit](../reference/glossary) finite difference time domain (FDTD) scheme to simulate wave propagation in two dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FDTD scheme breaks a domain down into equally-sized cells. For our simple 2D scheme, we will use square cells. Let us imagine our domain is also square, and 1m x 1m in size. We will discuss how to decide the size of the cells later in this tutorial. For now, all we need to know is that we will split our domain up into multiple cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "-- image of domain --\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use FDTD to provide an approximate solution to the scalar wave equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "-- equation --\n",
    "\n",
    "A finite difference approximation to this equation can be described as follows (see the theory section for how we got here):\n",
    "\n",
    "-- fd equation --\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is to approximate the evolution of the pressure and velocity fields in our domain over some specified duration. As this is a time-domain simulation, we consider the problem one time sample at a time. We will therefore start from some initial state, and follow the relation above to update the pressure and velocity values for each cell at the next time sample, on the basis of their exisiting values.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to know about the basic FDTD scheme is that the pressure and velocity fields are _staggered_, with velocity values exisiting at a location halfway between pressure values. Despite this, it is conventional to refer to the velocity components with the same spatial indeces as the pressure values. See the image below for an explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- image of a cell ---\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simulation, therefore, will start at time sample 0 with the pressure field P at t=0. The values in this pressure field will comprise our initial condition. From here, the velocity components in both dimensions are calculated. We then proceed to the next time step and update the pressure field, then the velocity fields, and so on for every time sample in the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We obtain the output of the simulation by selecting a receiver location (a single point on the mesh) and saving the pressure value at that mesh location every time sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the `numpy` library for convenient handling of arrays, the `matplotlib.pyplot` library for plotting the output, and the `scipy.io.wavfile` library to allow us to write the resulting audio to a wav file.\n"
