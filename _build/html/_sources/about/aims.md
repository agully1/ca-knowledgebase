# Aims and Principles

## Our goals

The goal of this knowledgebase is to facilitate research and development in computational acoustics using primarily open source tools. We do this by:

* Providing tutorial materials in Python which can be run directly from the browser.
* Incorporating routes for community contribution and feedback from the outset and at all stages of development.

## Our principles and constraints

In running this project, we aim to adhere to several principles that we believe will result in higher-quality technology that aligns with the core principles of the open source community. Here are a few key components:

* Give equal support to those who are new to computational acoustics as to those who consider themselves experts; not introduce complex new topics and code unless the necessary foundations are also provided.
* Prioritise open-source tools. We are not opposed to using commercial software, but will seek to ensure that users are first provided with open-source options wherever possible.
* Design for the future. While we have a bit of funding now, it won't last forever. This means that the knowledgebase should be easy for potential developers to read, understand, and improve.
* Don't try to do everything. Focus our efforts on quality materials covering the basic techniques, and material requested by the user community.
