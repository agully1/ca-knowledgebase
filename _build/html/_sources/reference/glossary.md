Absorbing boundary condition
    Definition

Boundary element method
    Definition

Courant number
    Definition

Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition
    Definition

Explicit scheme
    An explicit time-stepping scheme is one where the solution at time step n+1 is calculated based on existing (known) values from time step n.
	
Finite difference time domain (FDTD) method
    Definition
	
Finite element method (FEM)
    Definition

Homogeneous domain
    A homogeneous domain has the same material properties (e.g. density, speed of sound...) throughout the domain.
	
Heterogeneous domain
    A heterogeneous (or inhomogeneous) domain has material properties (e.g. density, speed of sound...) that vary throughout the domain.
	
Implicit scheme
    An implicit time-stepping scheme is one where the solution at time step n+1 is calculated using the (unknown) values at time step n+1, requiring the solution of an ODE.
