    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial cover the basics on how to solve the Helmholtz equation with Neumann boundary conditions by using FEniCS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Governing PDE\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the following symbols:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\Omega$ denotes an open set of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. $\\partial \\Omega$ denotes its boundary and $\\overline{\\Omega} \\doteq \\Omega \\cup \\partial \\Omega$ it's closure. $\\mathbf{x}$, a 3D vector, is the generic point in $\\overline{\\Omega}$.\n",
    "* $T$ denotes an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ $t$ is the generic point in $T$.\n",
    "* We denote the laplace operator with $\\nabla^2$.\n",
    "* We denote the Euclidean inner productwith $\\cdot$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we will index the components of vectors starting from $0$. This to be consistent with the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{0} \\\\ x_{1} \\\\ x_{2} \\end{bmatrix} \\in \\overline{\\Omega}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Helmholtz Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The lossless wave equation reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla^2 p\\left(\\mathbf{x},t\\right) = \\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 p\\left(\\mathbf{x},t\\right)}{\\partial t^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $p = p \\left(\\mathbf{x},t\\right)$ is the unknown pressure disturbance field, in Pascal. $p$ is defined in $\\overline{\\Omega} \\times T$ and has complex values. $c$ is the phase speed of sound in the medium, in meters per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "We impose that the pressure field is a steady state harmonic field:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p\\left(\\mathbf{x},t\\right) = u\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right) \\exp\\left(j\\omega t\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $u$ is the unknown spatial part of the field. $u$ is defined in $\\overline{\\Omega}$ and has complex values. $j$ is the imaginary unit and $\\omega$ is the angular frequncy of the field, in radians per second. If $\\nu$ denotes the frequency in Hertz we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\omega = 2\\pi\\nu = kc$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With $k$ the wave number.\n",
    "\n",
    "By substituting in the wave equation we obtain the Helmholtz equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla^2 u\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right) + k^2\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right) = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is our governing PDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boundary Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "The Helmholtz equation can be completed with Dirchlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dirchlet conditions are impose a specific value of $u$ on $\\partial \\Omega$.\n",
    "* Neumann conditions specify a normal particle displacment, velocity or acceleration on $\\partial \\Omega$.\n",
    "* Robin conditions specify an acoustic impedance on $\\partial \\Omega$ as well as an optional particle velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst the Dirchlet conditions are the simplest to deal with we will focus on Neumann conditions in this tutorial. This because prescription of particle velocity is the most common boundary condition for simple simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\partial \\Omega_l$ denote a partition of $\\partial \\Omega$, with $l=0,1,2,\\dots,L-1$, $L$ being the number of partitions. Let the complex valued function $w_l\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right)$ denote the prescribed normal component of the spatial part of the particle velocity field in $\\partial \\Omega _l$. Thanks to the Euler equation in frequency domain we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla u \\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right) = j\\omega\\rho w_l\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right) \\text{ for } \\mathbf{x} \\in \\partial \\Omega_l, \\space \\forall \\space l = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, L - 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\rho$ is the density of the medium and $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right)$ is the normal unit vector to $\\partial \\Omega$ in $\\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now able to prescribe normal particle velocity at each value of the boundary. To simplify notation, we define the acoustic bounday fluxes $g_l\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right)$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g_l\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right) \\doteq j\\omega\\rho w_l\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the equation bove reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla u \\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right) = g_l\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right) \\text{ for } \\mathbf{x} \\in \\partial \\Omega_l, \\space \\forall \\space l = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, L - 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Technically there is no need to partition $\\partial \\Omega$. One could have simply defined $w\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right)$ in $\\partial \\Omega$ and set it to the needed (eventual zero) values in the various parts of the boundary as needed. However it is easier to think in terms of partitions when working with FEniCS, as we will see.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Weak Form\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to convert our PDE into a weak form to solve our problem with FEniCS. This is done by recognising that $u$ is a vector of an appropriate Sobolev space. Then, another test function $\\phi$ is taken from the Sobolev space, with the requirement of being $0$ on $\\partial \\Omega$. Multiplication of the governing PDE with $\\phi$ and integration by parts lead to the weak form. The weak form reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_\\Omega \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla \\phi^\\star d\\mathbf{x} - k^2 \\int_\\Omega u \\phi^\\star d\\mathbf{x} = \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1}\\int_{\\partial \\Omega_l} g_l \\phi^\\star ds\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where we simplified notation by dropping the functions arguments. $d\\mathbf{x}$ denotes the volume element of $\\Omega$ while $ds$ denotes the surface element in $\\partial \\Omega$. $\\star$ denotes complex conjugation. Note that the equation above has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a \\left(u,\\phi\\right) = L\\left(\\phi\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $a$ and $L$ are the bilinear and linear form respectively. FEniCS requires the specification of these two quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "The Neumann boundary conditions feature directly in the weak form. The same goes for Robin conditions. However, Dirchlet boundary conditions don't and are treated separately.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### More Details\n",

    "We already derived the weak form for our problem. Domain meshing is instead what allows to reach an approximate numerical solution for our PDE. Meshing means that $\\Omega$ is cut in many non-overlapping subvolumes. We already mentioned how our uknown pressure spatial part $u$ is a vector in a Sobolev space. Through meshing we simplify this space to one that has _finite dimension_. This also transforms the integrals of the weak form in sums, which are then expressed as matrix-vector operations. We do not need to worry about these details: we specify the mesh and FEniCS will take care of the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one thing to keep in mind is that FEniCS does not support complex field. So we need to actually solve two coupled PDEs, one for the real part and one for the imaginary part.

    "You should pay attention to the fact that we use `dot` and `grad`. FEniCS also provides `inner` and `nabla_grad`. Since all of our fields are scalar the results do not vary if we use the other functions. However, they will for vector fields. You should always pick the most appropriate function for your problem.

    "As we seen in the definition of the bilinear form `a` FEniCS does not have a symbol for integral. We specify instead the integration variable. Above we used `fenics.dx` which is the integration variable for the volume. If we had different submodules we could define custom `dx` values to specify integration within the subvolumes. We will do something along these lines to specify the boundaries.\n",

    "To tell FEniCS that we have 6 sub-boundaries we need to crate 6 [SubDomain](https://fenicsproject.org/olddocs/dolfin/1.6.0/python/programmers-reference/cpp/mesh/SubDomain.html) objects. These will have an `inside` method that the object can use to figure out if a node of the mesh belongs to the sub-domain or not.\n",

    "If you were wondering why we needed a `tol` variable at the beginning: here your answer. Since we are dealing with a mesh each coordinate point of the nodes in the mesh is expressed as a floating point. This means that there might be small errors: maybe a point has $x_0$ (`x[0]`) value at `2.22e-16` instead of `0`. So we cannot really chech if the if `x[0]` is 0. We must check if it is near it, up to a tolerance.\n",
