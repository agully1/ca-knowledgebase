# Welcome to the UKAN Computational Acoustics Knowledgebase!
A home for the computational acoustics research, development and user community in the UK and beyond.

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.

How to use this site:

- New here? Read our {doc}`get-started` guide.
- Trying to decide on an appropriate computational acoustics method to use for your problem? Read our guide on {doc}`choose-method`.
- Want to get started right away with up-to-date computational acoustics software? Try one of our {doc}`user-guides`.
- Want to take a deeper dive into how each computational acoustics method works? Check out our open-source {doc}`tutorials` which build the methods up from scratch in Python, and read more in the {doc}`theory` sections.
- Want to contribute to the knowledgebase? Read our {doc}`contribution-guide`.
