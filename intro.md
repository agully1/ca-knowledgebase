```{admonition} More content to follow!
:class: tip
This is a pre-alpha version of the knowledgebase. Once up and running, it will also include:

* Tutorials building each of the common CA methods up from scratch in Python
* Theory sections outlining the underlying theory behind each method
* Case studies showing each method in use in some real acoustics research and development settings
* Guides to using common commercial and open-source CA software
* Example data for testing algorithms
* Community features

```
