:::{note}
- These are existing computational acoustics projects developed by our users. We have some documentation requirements, but these are generally much lower than for our tutorial material.
- Please note that unlike the rest of the knowledgebase, user-submitted code is **not necessarily open-source**, so please check the individual licenses. 
- User-submitted code is hosted on GitHub, so feedback and improvements can be suggested to the authors directly using normal GitHub interactions. 
- Please note that user-submitted code will vary considerably in up-to-dateness, size, functionality, and quality of documentation.
